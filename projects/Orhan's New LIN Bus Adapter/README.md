LIN Bus Adapter ESP32 v2

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
This board is a successor to the LIN Bus ESP32, where it uses less and cheaper components and
still manages to add a screen. This board essentialy creates a one-wire solution to communicate between
devices.

<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
Only 30 bucks for 5 without the esp32. (this is a lot cheaper that the last gen, which was 80 bucks for 5!)

<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
Datasheets definitely helped. Also looked at some devkit schematics from espressif.
